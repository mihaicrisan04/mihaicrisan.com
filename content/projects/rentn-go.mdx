This project was built for a local car rental business in Romania, providing them with a complete digital solution to manage their fleet and serve customers online.

## The Frontend

The customer-facing website features a clean, intuitive interface where users can browse available vehicles, check pricing, and make reservations. The design prioritizes simplicity—visitors can find what they need within seconds.

Key features include real-time availability checking, dynamic pricing based on rental duration, and a streamlined checkout process. The site is fully responsive and optimized for mobile users who often book on the go.

## Admin Dashboard

Behind the scenes, a comprehensive admin panel gives the business owner full control over operations. The dashboard provides an overview of active rentals, upcoming reservations, and fleet status at a glance.

Administrators can manage vehicle listings, update pricing, handle customer inquiries, and generate reports. The interface was designed to be simple enough that no technical training is required.

## Services Offered

The platform supports multiple service tiers:

**Standard Rentals** — Daily and weekly car rentals with flexible pickup and drop-off locations across the city.

**Airport Transfers** — Dedicated service for travelers arriving at or departing from Cluj-Napoca International Airport, with meet-and-greet options.

**Long-term Leasing** — Monthly rental packages for businesses and individuals needing extended vehicle access at discounted rates.

**Chauffeur Services** — Professional driver services for special events, business meetings, or city tours.
